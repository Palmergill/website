		<h4>Finance101</h4>
		<p id = "Post"><img src="imgs/Finance1.png", height=50% , width=45%> <img src="imgs/Finance2.png", height=45% , width=45%><br>This is an early prototype of a game I am making. I find finance and econmomics very interesting and have been investing in the stock market since I was 19. Personal fincance can be intimidating to some, so I wanted to create a game where people could learn some of the basics. Hopefully people will be able to have fun while they are learning, and not have to worry about losing real money.  I am using the swift programming language in Xcode to make this app.</p>
		<h4> RunningTime </h4>
		<p id = "Post"><img src="imgs/RunningTime1.png", height=50% , width=45%> <img src="imgs/RunningTime2.png", height=50% , width=45%><br> This is another game that I have been working on. This is a 3D game where you are trying to get a ball into a cup as fast as you can. This game is made using Unity's game engine. It has been fun working in a 3D environnment and getting to play around with the physics of the game. There are many features that I want to add to the game in the future, as it is early in its development. </p>
		<h4>My Website</h4>
		<p id = "Post"><img src="imgs/Website.png", height=60% , width=75%><br> This website that you are on is also a project that I made myself. I am using html and css , and I will keep updating as my life goes on. Thank you to anyone and everyone who helped me make this possible.  </p>
